Requirements! We need to come up with at least 10 functional requirements and at least 2 nonfuntional requirements for MentCare.
I'm not entirely sure what all that means, but hopefully we'll know more after tomorrow's class.
I will explain what functional and non-functional requirements are

Functional Requirements:
1. Details of patient information
2. Authorization of patient information
3. UI ( Login screens, main page, tabbed interfaces, etc)
4. MySQL Database to hold patients
5. Automatic backup of information
6. Patient medical history
7. Treatment plan
8. Maintaining patient information updated
9. 
10. 

Non Functional Requirements:
1. Security
2. Usability
3. Reliability
4. Privacy (as per HIPAA requirements)
