Requirements! We need to come up with at least 10 functional requirements and at least 2 nonfuntional requirements for MentCare.
I'm not entirely sure what all that means, but hopefully we'll know more after tomorrow's class.
I will explain what functional and non-functional requirements are

Functional Requirements:
1. details of patient information
2. authorization of patient information
3. UI ( Login screens, main page, tabbed interfaces, etc)
4. MySQL Database to hold patients
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
10. 

Non Functional Requirements:
1. Security
2. Usability
